# What is Phutball
[Phutball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phutball) (pronounced as football) is a two player strategy game described in [this book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Ways_for_your_Mathematical_Plays).

It has a host of interesting properties including
* Determining whether a player has a winning strategy with the ball centered is PSPACE hard.
* Answering the question "Can I win this turn?" is NP-Complete.
* John Conway (RIP) created the game alongside Elwyn Berlekamp and Richard K. Guy.

[Gil Kalai recounts](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4732#comment-1836693) a lovely story about learning Phutball from Conway.
> Conway set a special rule for me: Everytime I am convinced that I loose, we can switch sides. Needless to say that we switched sides several times; I was sure that my position is desperate beyond repair, we switched sides, and shortly afterward I was again sure that my position in the game is beyond repair.
